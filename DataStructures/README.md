# Coding Task
## Description
You are given a solution (DataStructures.zip) containing the task project and the tests. Your task is to implement methods (details below) until the tests are green.

### Part 1:

Implement linked list (DoublyLinkedList.cs) with functions:
* Length
* Add
* AddAt
* Remove
* RemoveAt
* ElementAt

Implement IEnumerable to make your list work with foreach (NOTE: you SHOULD NOT use YIELD operator)

### Part 2:
Implement the interface IHybridFlowProcessor<T> (HybridFlowProcessor.cs) using single internal item "storage" for both FILO and FIFO flows. Use a Double linked list in your implementation. Reusing your code from the previous task is desirable.
